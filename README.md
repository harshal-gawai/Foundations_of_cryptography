CS6111 - Foundations of Cryptography

**Course Data** :
    Objectives:
    Build a solid mathematical basis to understand foundations of cryptography
    Formally understand the notions related to security authentication and privacy.
    Provide a rigorous treatment of the emerging and key subject subarea of CSE - security.

**Course contents**:
    Basic functions of cryptology - encryption, signature and identification problems.
    Mathematical basics - basics of computational number theory - elliptic curves - pairing functions.
    Fundamental constructs -distinguishability - pseudo-random number generator - one way functions with trapdoor - some number theoretic candidates - RSA and        discrete log variants.
    security models for encryption schemes - CPA,CCA1,CCA2 security - secure hash functions - random oracle and standard models of proof techniques under various security models. RSA, El Gamal, Rabin, and Cremar-Shoup encryption schemes.
    Digital signatures - provably secure signature schemes - signcryption - ID-based and certificateless cryptology.
    Identification schemes - zero knowledge protocols - perfect, statistical, and computational zero knowledge - applications to commitment schemes.
